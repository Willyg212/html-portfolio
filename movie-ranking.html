<h3>Malibu's most wanted.</h3>
<p>This is the only movie that I can remember paying three separate times to watch and, each time I laughed.</p>
<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>Really cool sci-fi movie.</p>
<h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
<p>I thought this animated film was great with it's art, story, characters, and dialogue.</p>
