<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jose Gonzalez and I am currently working on a course for Web Development. My goal is to code
   as much as possible and end up in software engineering. I currently don't have any personal 
  projects and, I am looking for inspiration.
</p>

<p>I hold two general ed degrees, both are AA. Most of my work experience is warehouse work and manual labor
  jobs. I have experience working with teams and working individually.
